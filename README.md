## Use scenario
You, as a good citizen of the world, have decided that you cannot keep eating junk food that are not only bad for your health but also for the planet. You have taken the decision to change all of that.
When you launch the program you have two choices:
1. You can ask for a subsitute for a certain product,
2. You can see your saved substitutes from previous researches.

### Should you choose to search for a substitute :
The system will ask you which category of ingredient the one you want to replace belongs to while proposing different categories
Once you have choosen the category, the system will ask you to select the ingredient while once again proposing different ingredients inside the choosen category. Finally, the system will print out a substitute ingredient and propose you to save the result of this susbtitution.
Of course the system will propose you to make another search or to see saved susbtitutes after that.

### Should you choose to search a saved subtitute :
The system will propose to you the list of your previous saved search. You can pick one and by doing so the system will print out the ingreient you had choosen and the substitute previously found.
After that once again the system will propose you to make a new search or consult another saved substitute.
